## Data Types and Variables in Java: 🗃️

  - Data Types: Java is a statically typed language, meaning variables must be declared with a specific type, and their type cannot change during runtime. Common data types include int, double, String, boolean, and more.
  - Variables: Variables are used to store data values. In Java, you declare a variable with its data type, such as int, double, or String. Use keywords like "int" for integers, "double" for floating-point numbers, and "String" for sequences of characters.
  - Primitive Data Types: Java includes primitive data types such as int, double, char, boolean, byte, short, and long.
  - Numbers: In Java, numeric types like int and double represent integers and floating-point numbers, respectively.
  - Strings: In Java, strings are objects created from the String class. They represent sequences of characters and can be manipulated using various methods.
  - Booleans: Represent true or false values. Used for conditional statements and logical operations.
  - Null and Undefined: In Java, null represents the absence of a value, while uninitialized variables have a default value depending on their data type.
  - Objects: In Java, objects are instances of classes, allowing you to create complex data structures with attributes and methods.
  -  Arrays: Ordered collections of values in Java, accessed by indices starting from 0. They provide a way to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable.
  -  Methods: In Java, methods are blocks of code within classes. They are similar to functions and can be invoked to perform specific actions or return values.
